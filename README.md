# Let-sPlay_FLC2025_MiamiUniversity
This is a collective of contributors for a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) in 2024/25 in the [Let's Play](http://www.drpeterjamieson.com/LETS_PLAY/) model where we are learning about the intersection of AI and teaching and learning.

In this repository, we share what we have learned about AI and Teaching/Learning in the medium of the Let's Play Initiative

Any files and Organization are structured in the repository.  The main document is via the [Wiki](https://github.com/drpaj12/Let-sPlay_FLC2025_MiamiUniversity/wiki)
